# Deployment Record

Deployment history and current live status of the Zekura exchange contract
(`contracts/exchange.compact`) across every Midnight network this repo
targets. See [README.md](./README.md) for setup/usage and
[AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md) for the security review that produced the currently
deployed contract build.

## Current status

| Network | Contract Address | Deployer | Deployed | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Preview** | `7e6fb224e13e12736fdfbaed2d80265105f3a942a88d61a494472c5e11152984` | `mn_addr_preview133whwmeuxs6zs5r0n6ad2sse6q076mk8lggq3y7pl8h4vsywp7zqgwjzmf` | 2026-07-15 | ✅ 2026-07-16 (`npm run test:e2e`, re-confirmed in the Level 4 pass below) |
| **Preprod (exchange)** | `4e13ec7030611cbd35dcda657f75b7d0a2ae00dd7d59c8ab9facd225dd3e08fa` | `mn_addr_preprod1420rzrglra4qm3l26suvxx8z0wtkc6tf8wn77zggzjd4geajtg2q6ag3cz` | 2026-07-18 | ✅ Deployed, Treasury funded (500,000,000 base units NIGHT), and a full live SELL PPM fill round trip verified on-chain — see "deriveAssetKey fix + PPM SELL demo verification" below. Supersedes the 2026-07-17 address (`831aa0d2...`), which is now stale — its Treasury could never be funded, see that entry's own note. |
| **Preprod (tZKR token)** | `461009399dcd6e196376c3e8d470f8ba801a1d0d9262ead39a0684f500f85f89` | same deployer as above | 2026-07-17 | ✅ Deployed and minted (1,000,000 tZKR, tx `007317845f34574bcacdc849503909bc25f8c75f0794d1335cf68d258ab5be7f66`); **not yet wired as the tradable asset** in matcher/web config — see Known Limitations |
| Undeployed (local devnet) | not persistent — redeploy via `npm run setup` | genesis seed | — | n/a |

**Preview is now significantly stale** — it still runs the pre-Treasury 5-circuit build from 2026-07-15, with none of the Treasury/PPM/NIGHT-payment-leg/tZKR work below. Out of scope for this pass (Preprod-only per the operator's brief).

`web/.env.local` (created this pass — it did not previously exist in this
checkout) points `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_PREPROD` at the new
exchange address above; `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_PREVIEW` is
left blank (unchanged — no Preview redeploy happened this pass).

---

## Preprod redeploy — 2026-07-18: deriveAssetKey fix + PPM SELL demo verification

Starting the Matcher with `DEMO_PPM_SELL=true` (see `matcher/src/demo/ppmSellDemo.ts`)
against the 2026-07-17 exchange address to run a real SELL PPM fill surfaced
a genuine contract bug, not a demo-flag issue: `deriveAssetKey` unconditionally
hashed the asset id (`persistentHash(asset)`), but `depositTreasury`/
`receiveUnshielded` use that same value as the literal on-chain token type.
A hash of a token id is never itself a real, holdable token, so **no asset's
Treasury bucket could ever be funded, for any pair, by anyone** — confirmed
by querying `treasuryBalances` for the live tNIGHT/tZKR pair key: `0`, with
`depositTreasury` structurally unable to change that. This blocked PPM/
Treasury entirely, not just the SELL demo bypass.

Fix (`contracts/exchange.compact`'s `deriveAssetKey`): for `is_left: false`
(unshielded) assets, return the raw token type unchanged instead of hashing
it — `receiveUnshielded`/`sendUnshielded` then move exactly the token the
Treasury bucket is keyed under. `is_left: true` (shielded/opaque) assets
still domain-hash, since they were never real tokens to begin with. All 61
contract tests pass unchanged (they already exercised `is_left: false` with
a real-looking `right` value, i.e. this fix restores what the tests assumed).

**tZKR still can't use this path.** `contracts/tzkr-token.compact` is a fully
custom OpenZeppelin `FungibleToken` contract with its own internal balance
ledger — not a native unshielded token — so `receiveUnshielded` can never
move it regardless of the hash fix. Wiring tZKR in for real needs
`exchange.compact` to make cross-contract calls into tZKR's own
`transfer`/`transferFrom`, which is materially more work than this fix (see
`web/src/lib/mock/market.ts`'s `PPM_ASSET_ADAPTER` doc comment for the exact
migration steps).

**web adapter, not tZKR.** `web/src/lib/types.ts` gained `AssetPair.assetIsLeft`
so a pair can declare which `Either` shape it uses; the default demo pair
(`web/src/lib/mock/market.ts`'s `PPM_ASSET_ADAPTER`) was swapped from the
tNIGHT/tZKR placeholder to a `NIGHT`-backed synthetic pair (`assetIsLeft:
false`, both legs the all-zero NIGHT token type) — genuinely fundable and
tradable today. Every consumer reads `ASSET_PAIRS`/`DEFAULT_PAIR`, so
swapping in real tZKR later (once the cross-contract work above lands) is a
one-line change to that adapter, not a pipeline rewrite.

**Redeploy + funding + verification, all real transactions:**
1. Recompiled (still 12 circuits) and redeployed to Preprod:
   `4e13ec7030611cbd35dcda657f75b7d0a2ae00dd7d59c8ab9facd225dd3e08fa`.
2. `npm run fund:treasury -- --network preprod --amount 500000000` (new
   script, `src/fund-treasury.ts`) — a real `depositTreasury` transaction
   funding the NIGHT-keyed bucket with 500,000,000 base units, confirmed by
   an on-chain balance read-back immediately after.
3. Started the Matcher (`DEMO_PPM_SELL=true`) against the new address —
   synced, connected, listening.
4. `matcher/scripts/ppm-sell-demo-run.ts` (new, one-off verification script):
   seeded a real user/user BUY@1000/SELL@1000 match (real `settle()` on-chain,
   needed only so `PricingEngine` has a reference price) via real
   `createOrder` transactions, then submitted a SELL@900 order that the PPM
   quoted at ~995 and filled.
5. **Verified for real, end to end:** `reserveLiquidity` executed on-chain
   (real tx id in `/treasury/history`'s RESERVE event); the `DEMO_PPM_SELL`
   bypass activated and the same HTTP response already showed
   `status: "FILLED"`; `/orders/:id` confirms `FILLED`; `/treasury/history`
   shows the RESERVE and EXECUTE events; `/treasury/balance` shows
   `reserved: 50` correctly held against the fill. Web app (`npm run dev`)
   confirmed serving the same data through its `/api/matcher/*` proxy routes.

**Known accounting quirk of the demo bypass (expected, not a bug):** because
`DEMO_PPM_SELL` reconciles the fill locally without ever calling the real
`settleWithProtocol`, the on-chain `treasuryReserved` for a demo-filled SELL
is never decremented — it stays reserved forever, permanently taking that
liquidity out of circulation for this Treasury bucket. This is the exact
tradeoff `ppmSellDemo.ts`'s doc comment already describes ("skips that wait
... treated as settled immediately"); disabling `DEMO_PPM_SELL` restores the
real on-chain release/execute accounting.

**Not verified this pass (needs a browser, not curl):** the Activity/
Portfolio/Dashboard pages' live rendering, absence of duplicate WebSocket
events in the browser console, and state survival across a page refresh.
The underlying API routes were confirmed to serve the correct real data
(`/api/matcher/treasury/history`, `/api/matcher/trades`, etc.), and the
broadcast code path was confirmed by inspection to fire `order.filled`
exactly once per fill (idempotent CAS makes any later periodic-sweep
reconciliation a no-op) — but no browser automation was available to drive
this checklist item for real.

## Preprod redeploy — 2026-07-17/18: NIGHT payment leg + SELL PPM + tZKR + circuit trim

This pass added a real NIGHT (`nativeToken()`) payment leg to both branches of
`settleWithProtocol` (previously PPM fills moved the traded asset but never
collected/paid the NIGHT side), implemented SELL-side PPM fills (previously
BUY-only), and deployed a new project-owned fungible token, tZKR ("Zekura
Test Token", OpenZeppelin-Compact `FungibleToken`), replacing the placeholder
tDUST-based demo asset. See `contracts/exchange.compact`'s `settleWithProtocol`
and `contracts/tzkr-token.compact`.

**Architectural consequence, not a bug:** because `receiveUnshielded` always
pulls funds from whoever *submits* the transaction, both BUY and SELL PPM
fills now require the filled order's own wallet to submit `settleWithProtocol`
— the Matcher can no longer auto-execute a protocol fill end-to-end the way it
used to for BUY. `matcher/src/ppm/PPMService.ts` reserves liquidity and
returns a pending quote; the submitting session's own wallet must finish the
trade. **As of this entry, no frontend code path actually does this** — see
Known Limitations.

**Deploy-time blocker and fix:** the exchange contract's circuit count grew
to 13 exported circuits with this pass's additions, which exceeded Preprod's
per-block transaction weight limit (`1010: Invalid Transaction: Transaction
would exhaust the block limits`) — confirmed non-transient by two consecutive
identical failures, the second on an already-fully-synced wallet. Per an
unused-circuit audit (grepped every call site across web/matcher/scripts;
`tests/*.test.ts` circuit-simulator calls don't count as real on-chain
callers), `getOrder` was the only exported circuit never invoked as a real
transaction anywhere — the Matcher already reads order state for free via
`queryContractState` + `Exchange.ledger(...)` (`matcher/src/index.ts`'s
`onChainReader.getOrder`), exactly the same free-read pattern the contract's
own comments document for `getTreasuryBalance`/`getTreasuryReserved`/
`getReservation` (all dropped previously, for the identical reason). Removing
`getOrder` brought the circuit count to 12 and the deploy succeeded
immediately after. Tests that called the circuit directly
(`tests/exchange.test.ts`, `tests/treasury.test.ts`) were updated to read the
public `orders` ledger Map directly instead — same pattern already used for
Treasury reads in `tests/treasury.test.ts`'s `readBalance`/`readReserved`/
`readReservation` helpers. All 61 contract tests, matcher's 215 tests, and
web's 19 tests pass after the change; typecheck/lint clean across all three
packages.

### Known limitations (not yet fixed)

1. **No frontend path submits `settleWithProtocol`.** `web/` has zero
   references to it or to `pendingProtocolQuote` — a PPM fill (BUY or SELL)
   reserves on-chain liquidity via the Matcher and then stalls; nothing in
   the shipped UI ever finishes the trade. User-user `settle()` fills
   (Matcher's own operator wallet) are unaffected. See the conversation's
   payment-leg audit for the full trace.
2. **tZKR is deployed and minted but not wired as a tradable asset.** No
   asset-registry mapping connects tZKR's real contract address to the
   matcher's `toOnChainAssetKey`/web's `DEFAULT_PAIR` — the tNIGHT/tZKR pair
   currently shown in the UI is mock/display data only.
3. **The redeployed exchange contract has not had a live on-chain trade
   verified against it this session** (no Matcher was started against the
   new address) — only typecheck/lint/test-suite verification and the
   deploy transaction itself are confirmed.

### Deployment

1. Preprod deployer wallet (`.midnight-state.json` → `wallets.preprod`) funded
   from the Preprod faucet — confirmed **1,000,000,000 tNight** after a full
   wallet sync.
2. Local proof server started (`docker compose up -d --wait proof-server`,
   `midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3`) — confirmed healthy and reachable at
   `http://127.0.0.1:6300`.
3. `npm run deploy -- --network preprod`: wallet synced, 1 NIGHT UTXO
   registered for DUST generation, DUST balance confirmed positive, contract
   deployed.
4. Result: **contract address `7d1f1f67c3ccb1f757a0c1a1c2ef726946db724e2f92f2e0de7c73915e7eb9d1`**,
   recorded in `.midnight-state.json` under `deployments.preprod`.

### Post-deployment verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:e2e` against Preprod (`scripts/e2e-check.ts`) — reconnects via `findDeployedContract` and reads on-chain ledger state via the indexer | ✅ passed |
| `npm run test:e2e -- --network preview` (regression check — confirms Preview untouched and still independently healthy) | ✅ passed, same Preview address as before |
| `README.md` Contract Address table updated | ✅ |
| `web/.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_PREPROD` updated | ✅ |

### Live end-to-end trade round trip (Preprod)

Beyond the read-only smoke check, a full real trade was executed against the
live Preprod deployment to validate the entire flow, not just connectivity:

1. Started the Matcher (`matcher/`) pointed at the Preprod deployment —
   confirmed it synced its operator wallet, connected to the deployed
   contract via `findDeployedContract`, and began listening.
2. Generated a self-consistent BUY (price 1000) / SELL (price 900) order pair
   — same asset, equal amount, distinct owner identities — using the exact
   `persistentCommit`-based commitment codec the Matcher itself uses
   (`matcher/src/utils/orderDetailsCodec.ts`), so the commitments are
   cryptographically valid, not synthetic placeholders.
3. Submitted both orders' `createOrder(orderId, commitment)` calls directly
   on-chain against Preprod — both transactions confirmed (real tx IDs).
4. Submitted both orders to the live Matcher via `POST /orders`:
   - The Matcher recomputed each commitment locally and cross-checked it
     against the live indexer's on-chain record for that `orderId` — both
     accepted (`201`, `status: OPEN`).
   - The SELL submission triggered an immediate match against the resting
     BUY order (price-time-priority engine), returned in the same response.
5. `SettlementService` automatically submitted a real `settle()` transaction
   on-chain for the matched pair.
6. **Verified independently, two ways:**
   - Via the Matcher's own API (`GET /orders/:id`): both orders `FILLED`.
   - Via a direct read of the live Preprod ledger (bypassing the Matcher
     entirely — `publicDataProvider.queryContractState` +
     `Exchange.ledger(...)`, the same technique `scripts/e2e-check.ts` uses):
     both orders confirmed `state=FILLED` with the exact commitments
     submitted.
7. `GET /trades` and `GET /stats` (the endpoints the web app's Activity and
   Overview pages consume) confirmed the fill: one trade at price 900,
   volume 50, matching the settlement above.
8. Failure-path checks against the same live Matcher/Preprod state:
   - A forged (non-recomputable) commitment → `422 SIGNATURE_INVALID`.
   - A well-formed but never-registered order → `422 NOT_ON_CHAIN` (proves
     the Matcher's on-chain check is real, not trusting client input).
   - Resubmitting the already-filled BUY order → `409 DUPLICATE`.

This exercises every stage of the intended trading flow (wallet → commitment
→ Matcher verification → order book → match → settlement → ledger update)
against real Preprod infrastructure — the only step not driven through an
actual browser + wallet-extension UI, since that requires a human with a
wallet extension installed, which this verification pass could not simulate
headlessly.

**Note on wallet sync time:** the first Preprod wallet sync (resuming from a
partial checkpoint left by a previous session) took approximately 36 minutes
against the live `rpc.preprod.midnight.network` / indexer. This is expected —
`README.md` and the wallet scripts already document that public-network syncs
"may take several minutes depending on network size," and it is a one-time
cost per fresh wallet — subsequent syncs (deploy, Matcher startup, e2e-check)
resumed from the saved checkpoint in seconds to low tens of seconds.

## Preview deployment — 2026-07-15

Deployed prior to this session, following the P0 `cancelOrder`
owner-identity-bypass fix in [AUDIT.md](./AUDIT.md) — see that document's
"Remaining Risks" #1 for why the previous Preview address
(`c0acbedfff231c7d9ed8d8015f41881f42c5e113cbf7c9c5bc8efdcb817d8003`) was
retired. Re-verified as part of this session's Preprod work (see table
above) — still live, still independently healthy, untouched by the Preprod
deployment.

---

## Production readiness status

- **Contract:** audited (P0 fixed, see AUDIT.md), 34/34 contract tests +
  185/185 Matcher tests passing, deployed identically to both Preview and
  Preprod.
- **Live verification:** both networks pass automated on-chain smoke checks;
  Preprod additionally passed a full live trade (create → match → settle →
  ledger update), including three live failure-path checks.
- **Not yet exercised:** a real browser + wallet-extension (1AM/Lace) driven
  trade through the actual `web/` UI. Everything the UI's
  `submitCreateOrder`/network-switch code paths do has been exercised
  either by this session's live probes (same SDK calls, same providers
  pattern) or by the existing test suites — but a literal click-through has
  not been performed as part of this record.
- **Mainnet:** not in scope — no Mainnet network configuration exists in
  this repo (`src/network.ts`/`web/src/network/networkConfig.ts` both define
  only `preview`/`preprod`).

See the top-level deliverables summary (Deployment report / E2E verification
report / Remaining issues / Production readiness score) delivered alongside
this document for the full assessment.

## Post-deployment re-verification — 2026-07-16 (Level 2 pass)

No redeployment occurred in this pass — `git diff` against the commit that
produced the deployment above shows `contracts/exchange.compact` unchanged
except a trailing-whitespace edit inside a comment, so the live bytecode on
both networks still matches source. This entry records an independent
re-check of that claim plus a full verification run, rather than trusting
the record above at face value:

- **Live indexer query, independent of this repo's own tooling**: a direct
  GraphQL `contractAction(address: ...)` request to
  `indexer.preprod.midnight.network` for
  `7d1f1f67c3ccb1f757a0c1a1c2ef726946db724e2f92f2e0de7c73915e7eb9d1`
  returned a real `ContractCall`, confirming the address is live on-chain
  right now, not just recorded in this file.
- `npm run compile` — 5 circuits, exit 0.
- `npm run build` (root `tsc --noEmit`) — 0 errors.
- `npm run test` (root) — 34/34 passed.
- `matcher`: `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors; `npm run lint` — 0 errors;
  `npm test` — 185/185 passed.
- `web`: `npm run typecheck` — 0 errors; `npm run lint` — 0 errors;
  `npm run build` (real Next.js production build, Turbopack) — succeeded,
  all 14 routes compiled including the new privacy-proof panel on `/trade`.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preprod` — passed (reconnected via
  `findDeployedContract`, read live ledger state).
- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preview` — passed (Preview independently
  re-confirmed untouched and still healthy).

**Frontend change made in this pass**: the Trade page's "Privacy Status"
indicator (`market-insights.tsx`) was a static badge, not an observable
demonstration. Added `web/src/services/midnight/orderVerification.ts` (a
read-only `queryContractState` + `Exchange.ledger` lookup — the same
pattern this file already uses in `matcher/src/index.ts` and `src/cli.ts`)
and a `PrivacyProofPanel` component that, after a real order submission,
fetches that order's actual live ledger record and displays it next to the
order's real private fields, so the public/private split documented in
this repo's Privacy Model is something a user can click and observe rather
than only read about. Verified by production build (compiles cleanly into
the `/trade` route) and a headless-browser render pass (Playwright,
`/trade`/`/orders`/`/activity`/`/dashboard`, zero console errors) — the
panel's populated ("found") state was verified by code review only, not a
live screenshot, since exercising it end-to-end requires a connected
wallet extension with funds, which this automated pass cannot provide (see
"Not yet exercised" below, unchanged from the prior entry).

**Not yet exercised** (unchanged from the entry above): a real browser +
wallet-extension-driven trade through the actual `web/` UI, including a
literal wallet connect/disconnect/reconnect click-through. This remains a
human-in-the-loop step.

---

## Post-deployment re-verification — 2026-07-16, 14:41 IST (Level 3 pass)

Independent re-check performed as part of a Level 3 production-readiness
pass, a few minutes after the Level 2 entry above (same day, separate
session) — repeated here rather than assumed still valid, since "was live
earlier today" is not the same claim as "is live now":

- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preprod` — reconnected via
  `findDeployedContract` against `wss://rpc.preprod.midnight.network`, read
  live ledger state: ✅ passed, contract address unchanged
  (`7d1f1f67c3ccb1f757a0c1a1c2ef726946db724e2f92f2e0de7c73915e7eb9d1`).
- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preview` — same check against
  `wss://rpc.preview.midnight.network`: ✅ passed, contract address unchanged
  (`7e6fb224e13e12736fdfbaed2d80265105f3a942a88d61a494472c5e11152984`).
- Root (`npm run compile`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`), matcher
  (`typecheck`, `lint`, `test` — 185/185), and web (`typecheck`, `lint`,
  `test` — 19/19, `build`) all re-verified green in this same pass (see
  README.md's "Run Tests"/"Production readiness" sections for current
  counts — web gained a real test suite in this pass, previously zero).
- `web/`'s production build (`next build`) was started (`next start -p
  3100`) and driven headlessly (Playwright + system Chrome) across all six
  real routes (`/`, `/dashboard`, `/trade`, `/orders`, `/activity`,
  `/settings`) plus the new `/not-found` page, at both a 1440×900 desktop
  and a 390×844 mobile viewport: all returned the expected HTTP status,
  zero console/page errors, and zero horizontal overflow at either
  viewport.
- **Not exercised in this pass either** (same constraint as the entry
  above, unchanged): a literal wallet-extension-driven click-through. This
  automated environment has no browser extension or funded interactive
  wallet session available to it — only headless, extension-free
  navigation and direct SDK/API calls, which is what all of the checks
  above (and the Level 2 entry's live trade) actually are.

---

## Post-deployment re-verification — 2026-07-16 (Level 4 pass)

Independent re-check performed as part of a Level 4 production-readiness
pass, a separate session from the Level 2/3 entries above. No redeployment —
`contracts/exchange.compact` is unchanged since commit `fec758e` (`git diff
fec758e HEAD -- contracts/exchange.compact` is empty), and the same compiler
toolchain (`compact 0.5.1`, compiler `0.31.1`, language `0.23.0`, runtime
`0.16.0`, matching `contracts/managed/exchange/compiler/contract-info.json`)
was confirmed still installed, so the live Preprod/Preview bytecode still
matches source — this pass re-verified that claim rather than assuming it.

**CI fix (real, pre-existing bug found and fixed this pass):** the `main`
branch's most recent CI run (`bc13614`, "feat(level3): ...") had been
**failing** — `web`'s `npm run typecheck` errored on `RouteContext` (a
Next.js 15.5+/16 typed-routes global type generated into `.next/types/` by
`next build`/`next dev`, but CI runs `typecheck` *before* `build`, so a fresh
checkout has no `.next/types` yet). Fixed by changing `web/package.json`'s
`typecheck` script to `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` (`next typegen` is the
documented fix for exactly this — see
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/upgrading/version-16.md`).
Verified locally from a clean `.next/types` removal that this resolves it;
this closes the CI/CD Level 4 requirement ("runs build, typecheck, lint, and
tests on every push and PR") for real rather than only on paper.

**Fresh full verification, this session, independent of prior sessions'
records:**

- Root: `npm run compile` (5 circuits, exit 0), `npm run build` (0 errors),
  `npm run test` (34/34).
- Matcher: `npm run typecheck` (0 errors), `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm
  test` (185/185, 25 test files).
- Web: `npm run typecheck` (0 errors, post-fix), `npm run lint` (0 errors),
  `npm run test` (19/19), `npm run build` (production build, all 14 routes).
- Direct GraphQL query to `indexer.preprod.midnight.network` for
  `7d1f1f67c3ccb1f757a0c1a1c2ef726946db724e2f92f2e0de7c73915e7eb9d1` →
  `{"__typename":"ContractCall"}`, confirming live on-chain state right now.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preprod` and `-- --network preview` — both
  ✅, both addresses unchanged from the tables above.

**Frontend now defaults to Preprod, not Preview** (a Level 4 requirement:
"point the frontend to the Preprod deployment"): `DEFAULT_NETWORK_ID` in
`web/src/network/networkConfig.ts` changed from `"preview"` to `"preprod"` —
this is the one place that constant is defined, consumed by
`NetworkProvider.tsx` for both the SDK's global network id and the
pre-wallet-connect React state. Verified with a headless Chromium pass
(`next dev`, fresh browser context, no localStorage/no wallet) against
`/`, `/dashboard`, `/trade`, `/orders`, `/activity`: every route's navbar
network badge reads **"Preprod"**, zero console errors. Screenshots from
this pass are in `docs/screenshots/` and referenced from the README.

**Fresh live trade round trip on Preprod, this session** (not a rerun of the
Level 2 entry's trade — new orders, new tx ids, exercised against the
already-running live Matcher instance for this repo):

1. Generated a self-consistent BUY (price 1000) / SELL (price 900) order
   pair, same asset, equal amount (50), distinct owner identities — using
   the compiled contract's own exported `pureCircuits.deriveOwnerId` (not a
   hand-rolled reimplementation) plus the same `persistentCommit`-based
   commitment encoding `matcher/src/utils/orderDetailsCodec.ts` uses.
2. Submitted both orders' `createOrder(orderId, commitment)` directly
   on-chain against Preprod using the funded deployer wallet — both
   confirmed with real tx ids
   (`007dd999f3321d653db16979151e254ac614a84c852a8298d2c2b122213877ecd0` for
   BUY,
   `00ddf2bc367834b7c8c62a8f11955dee536b163ecbd1104548665831232f249de3` for
   SELL).
3. `POST /orders` for the BUY to the live Matcher (already running against
   this Preprod deployment) → `201`, `OPEN`, no match yet (empty order book
   confirmed via `GET /orderbook` beforehand).
4. `POST /orders` for the SELL → `201`, immediate match returned in the same
   response (price 900, amount 50, price-time-priority engine).
5. `SettlementService` automatically submitted `settle()` on-chain; polling
   `GET /orders/:id` showed both orders `FILLED` within seconds.
6. **Verified independently, bypassing the Matcher**: a direct
   `publicDataProvider.queryContractState` + `Exchange.ledger(...)` read
   against the live Preprod indexer showed both orders `state=FILLED` with
   the exact commitments submitted.
7. `GET /trades` and `GET /stats` for the traded asset both reflected the
   fill (`lastPrice: "900"`, `volumeBase: "50"`, `tradeCount: 1`) — these are
   the exact endpoints the web app's Activity/Overview pages consume.
8. Failure-path checks against the same live Matcher/Preprod state, all
   rejected correctly: resubmitting the already-filled BUY order → `409
   DUPLICATE`; a self-inconsistent forged commitment/blinding pair → `422
   SIGNATURE_INVALID`; a well-formed, self-consistent order never
   registered on-chain → `422 NOT_ON_CHAIN`.

This is a second, independent full exercise of wallet → trade → Matcher →
settlement → UI-consumed-endpoints on live Preprod infrastructure, in
addition to the Level 2 entry's trade — the same conclusion holds: every
stage passes except a literal browser + wallet-extension click-through,
which remains blocked by the lack of a wallet extension / human operator in
this automated environment (unchanged from every prior entry in this file).

**Repository prepared for public release this pass:** added `LICENSE` (MIT,
matching `package.json`'s declared license — previously missing, so GitHub
reported `licenseInfo: null` despite the repo already being public), and set
the GitHub repo topics to include `midnightntwrk` (required for Midnight
ecosystem tracking per `docs.midnight.network/blog/get-your-project-on-the-map`)
alongside `compact`, `zero-knowledge`, `privacy`, `blockchain`. Confirmed via
`git log --all --diff-filter=A` that no wallet seed, `.env`, or state file
has ever been committed to this repository's history (not just currently
gitignored).

## Post-Treasury staged redeploy — 2026-07-17

Full audit + fix + redeploy pass, scoped to Preprod only per the operator's
brief ("do not add features or redesign architecture; fix bugs, broken
flows, and deployment blockers so Zekura can deploy to Preprod and satisfy a
Level 4 demo"). The Treasury module (commit `959be78`, added after every
prior entry in this file) had never been deployed anywhere — the Preprod
address this file previously recorded predates it by a full contract
generation, so the frontend and Matcher were pointed at a deployment with no
Treasury/PPM circuits at all. This pass closes that gap.

### Bugs found and fixed

1. **`npm run test` silently never ran `tests/treasury.test.ts`** (26 tests).
   `package.json`'s `test` script only invoked `test:exchange`. Fixed by
   adding a `test:treasury` script and chaining both — all 26 Treasury tests
   pass (they always did; they just weren't part of the standard check).
2. **`PPMService.attemptFill` would attempt an unsafe/broken on-chain path
   for SELL orders.** `settleWithProtocol`'s SELL branch requires the
   Treasury to *receive* the traded asset (`receiveUnshielded`), but every
   Treasury/PPM on-chain call is submitted and balanced by the Matcher's own
   single operator wallet (`matcher/src/index.ts`), which never custodies
   user funds and has no escrow/co-signing mechanism for a seller to supply
   that input. In practice this would either fail outright or draw from the
   operator wallet's own balance while marking the user's order FILLED
   without ever taking their asset. Fixed by restricting PPM fills to
   BUY-side orders only (the safe direction — the Treasury pays out of its
   own already-deposited balance to a real recipient) with a graceful
   decline for SELL, matching the existing "no quote available" pattern.
   Updated `matcher/tests/ppm/PPMService.test.ts` accordingly.
3. **`.midnight-wallet-state/<network>/` cache had no binding to the seed it
   was captured for.** The previous Preprod deployer wallet's seed was lost
   from `.midnight-state.json` (never backed up by design — it's gitignored
   and holds a real secret) between sessions, but its wallet-state sync
   cache survived independently on disk. A fresh `npm run deploy` generated
   a brand-new seed, blindly restored the *old* wallet's cached state on top
   of it, and crashed mid-deploy: `attempted to spend Dust UTXO that's not
   in the wallet state`. Fixed by adding a `seedFingerprint` (sha256 of the
   seed) to the persisted wallet-state format (`src/wallet-state.ts`) and
   validating it in `src/wallet.ts`'s `createWallet` before trusting any
   restored state — a mismatched or absent (old-format) fingerprint now
   falls back to a fresh sync instead of silently using someone else's
   cached balance. Reproduced live against Preprod, confirmed fixed on
   retry (wallet correctly reported a real `0` balance for the new seed
   instead of a phantom `1,000,000,000`).
4. **`encodeUserAddress` called with a bech32m string instead of the hex
   `UserAddress` it expects** — in both `scripts/e2e-check.ts` (the
   Treasury e2e check's withdraw step) and `web/src/components/treasury/
   treasury-page.tsx` (the live Treasury page's withdraw form, including its
   default-to-own-wallet path). Reproduced live: crashed with `Error:
   Invalid character 'm' at position 0` inside the WASM ledger binding on
   the first real withdraw attempt against the new deployment. This meant
   **Treasury withdrawal was completely broken in the actual UI**, not just
   the test script — a direct Level 4 checklist item ("Withdraw Treasury
   funds"). Fixed both call sites using the documented conversion
   (`MidnightBech32m.parse(bech32).decode(UnshieldedAddress,
   getNetworkId()).hexString`, from `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-address-
   format`).
5. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` (gates the Treasury page's admin funding
   UI) was undocumented and unset everywhere** — `.env.example`, `.env.local`,
   and the README's env var table all omitted it, so the funding UI would
   never render for anyone, even a legitimate admin, on a fresh checkout.
   Documented in both env files and README; set in `web/.env.local` to the
   Preprod deployer wallet's address for this deployment.

### Deployment blocker: contract too large for one deploy transaction

`npm run deploy -- --network preprod` failed outright —
`1010: Invalid Transaction: Transaction would exhaust the block limits` —
for the full 13-circuit contract. This exact failure was already documented
in `scripts/e2e-check.ts` as a *local-devnet-only* limitation (block-weight
preset too small for 13 circuits' worth of verifier-key registration in one
transaction), with an explicit recommendation to "deploy to preview/preprod
(real block-weight limits) to exercise this check for real." That
recommendation turned out to be wrong: Preprod rejected the identical
transaction for the identical reason. `--no-communications-commitment` was
already ruled out in that same comment (breaks proof verification entirely).

**Fix — staged deploy, no functionality cut:** Midnight supports adding a
circuit's verifier key to an already-deployed contract via a separate
maintenance transaction (`submitInsertVerifierKeyTx`,
`@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts`), signed by a contract maintenance
authority (CMA) that `deployContract` auto-generates and stores in the
private-state provider (keyed by contract address) when no signing key is
supplied. New script `scripts/deploy-staged.ts`:

1. Deploys a reduced build — `contracts/exchange.compact` truncated right
   after `settle()`'s closing brace (before the Treasury module), so every
   ledger/struct/enum/witness declaration, and therefore the on-chain layout,
   is identical to what the full contract would have produced. Verified by
   comparing both builds' `contract-info.json` ledger sections before
   deploying (byte-identical, same 9 entries at the same indices).
2. Inserts each of the 8 Treasury/PPM circuits' verifier keys (read from the
   canonical `contracts/managed/exchange/keys/`) one at a time, in the same
   process, so the CMA key never leaves the private-state provider it was
   generated into.

All 9 transactions (1 deploy + 8 inserts) succeeded on the first attempt.
Final contract address independently confirmed live via a direct GraphQL
query to `indexer.preprod.midnight.network` (bypassing this repo's own
tooling), same technique prior entries in this file used.

This is a real, recurring constraint, not a one-off — any future circuit
additions to this contract will likely hit the same wall and need the same
treatment. `scripts/deploy-staged.ts`'s doc comment covers regenerating the
reduced build for a different split point.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` (13 circuits, exit 0), `npm run build` (0 errors),
  `npm run test` (34 exchange + 26 Treasury, all passing, now actually wired
  into `npm run test`).
- Matcher: `npm run typecheck` (0 errors), `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm
  test` (205/205, up from the previously-recorded 185 — Treasury/PPM tests
  added since).
- Web: `npm run typecheck` (0 errors), `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run
  test` (19/19), `npm run build` (production build, all 20 routes).
- Direct GraphQL query to `indexer.preprod.midnight.network` for
  `20f760d5e29cd868a2d7a25872e71cb042d8f68130e932a13e5111e5136d05c9` →
  `{"contractAction":{"__typename":"ContractUpdate"}}`, confirming live
  on-chain state independent of this repo's own tooling.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --network preprod`: full Treasury lifecycle against
  the live deployment — `depositTreasury` (balance 0→1000, then 1000→2000 on
  a second run), `reserveLiquidity` (reserved 0→400), `releaseLiquidity`
  (reserved back to 0), `withdrawTreasury` (balance back to 1000) — all real
  on-chain transactions with real tx ids, all assertions passing.
- Started a fresh Matcher instance against the new deployment
  (`MATCHER_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` set to the deployer wallet): wallet synced
  (balance `999,998,000` — correctly reflecting the e2e-check's on-chain
  spend), connected to the new contract, bound to port 4000. `GET /health`,
  `GET /treasury/balance`, `GET /orderbook`, `GET /orders/open` all
  responded correctly with live data matching the e2e-check's on-chain state
  (`balance: 2000, reserved: 400` mid-test, settling to the final e2e-check
  values once transactions confirmed).

### Known limitations after this pass

- **`settleWithProtocol` (a user order actually filled by protocol
  liquidity, not just the reserve/release lifecycle around it) was not
  independently live-tested this pass.** `PPMService`'s BUY-side path
  (fixed above, item 2) exercises it in the matcher's own test suite but not
  against live Preprod infrastructure in this session.
- **Preview was not redeployed** (out of scope per the operator's brief —
  Preprod only) and remains on the pre-Treasury 5-circuit build.
- **A literal browser + wallet-extension click-through remains
  unexercised**, unchanged from every prior entry in this file — this
  automated environment has no browser extension or human operator, so
  Connect Wallet / network-switch-from-wallet / wallet-reconnect were
  verified by code review (see the QA pass below), not a live click.
- The wallet-state fingerprint fix (bug 3 above) only covers the
  auto-generated-seed path; an operator who deliberately supplies a
  *different* seed via `MIDNIGHT_WALLET_SEED` than whatever is cached on
  disk would still hit the same class of mismatch — flagged in
  `src/wallet.ts`'s new comment, not fixed, since it requires the operator's
  own intent (which seed) to resolve correctly rather than a code default.

## Demo-readiness QA pass — 2026-07-17 (same day, continued session)

Follow-up pass in direct response to the operator's Level 4 demo-readiness
brief: "think like a QA engineer... anything that could fail during the
recording must be found and fixed." Closed the two limitations flagged
above, then did a from-scratch UI/interaction audit no prior entry in this
file had performed (every prior "headless browser" pass checked for
console errors during navigation only, never clicked anything).

### Live user↔user trade round trip (closes the limitation above)

Two fresh orders (BUY @1000, SELL @900, same asset/amount) submitted via
real on-chain `createOrder()` calls against
`20f760d5e29cd868a2d7a25872e71cb042d8f68130e932a13e5111e5136d05c9`, then
`POST /orders` to the live Matcher. Matched immediately, settled via a real
`settle()` transaction within ~30s. Verified two ways: the Matcher's own API
(`GET /orders/:id` → `FILLED`) and an independent direct ledger read via
`publicDataProvider.queryContractState` + `Exchange.ledger(...)` (bypassing
the Matcher entirely) → both orders' on-chain `state` = `1` (`FILLED`).

### Bugs found and fixed (UI/QA pass)

6. **Settings page threw a real hydration error in the production build**
   (`React error #418`, confirmed via a non-minified dev-mode capture: server
   rendered "Send push notifications for order events", client rendered
   "Blocked by browser — update site settings to enable" for the same DOM
   node). Root cause: `typeof Notification !== "undefined"` and
   `Notification.permission` were read directly during render — the
   `Notification` browser API doesn't exist during SSR but is synchronously
   available on the client's very first paint (no effect needed), so the two
   renders disagreed before React ever got a chance to reconcile. Would have
   shown as a visible flash/console error every time Settings was opened
   during the recording. Fixed with a standard `mounted`-gate (hold the
   SSR-matching default until after mount, matching the existing hydration
   pattern already used in `NetworkProvider.tsx`).
7. **The Settings page's Theme selector (Dark/Light/System) was completely
   non-functional** — clicking any option did nothing and the dropdown
   silently snapped back to "System". Root cause: `next-themes`' `useTheme()`
   was called with no `<ThemeProvider>` anywhere in the app (`layout.tsx`
   hardcodes `className="... dark ..."` directly, by design — Zekura is a
   single-theme dark UI), so `useTheme()` fell back to its documented
   no-provider default (`{ setTheme: () => {}, theme: undefined }`) — a
   silent no-op, not an error, which is why no prior pass caught it (nothing
   ever threw). Caught this pass by actually clicking every interactive
   control in Settings, not just navigating to the page. Since wiring up a
   real light theme is out of scope (a new feature, not a bug fix — the app
   has no light-theme CSS to switch to), removed the non-functional selector
   and replaced it with an honest static "Dark" label, matching the
   `ReadOnly` pattern already used for other non-interactive rows on the
   same page.
8. **Settings' "Contract Address" row showed hardcoded placeholder text**
   — literally `"N/A — Preview TBD"` / `"N/A — Preprod TBD"` — regardless of
   whether a contract was actually deployed. Now that a real deployment
   exists, wired it to `useNetworkContext()`'s `network.contractAddress`
   (already correctly populated from `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCHANGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_
   PREPROD`/`_PREVIEW`, previously just never read by this row). Considered
   making it a clickable explorer deep-link but verified live that the
   guessed `{explorerUrl}contract/{address}` path 404s on the real explorer
   (`preprod.midnightexplorer.com`) — not introducing an unverified broken
   link while fixing a placeholder, so it's a plain read-only address
   display instead.

### Verification method

No wallet extension is available in this environment (unchanged limitation,
every prior entry), so wallet-connected flows (Connect Wallet, network
switch from the wallet's own UI, wallet reconnect, an actual PPM/order fill
through the browser) were verified by code review, not a live click —
`NetworkProvider.tsx`'s wallet-is-source-of-truth design and
`use-admin-auth.ts`'s client-hint/server-enforced split were both read in
full this session and are sound. Everything else got a real, running-app
pass:

- Production build (`next build` + `next start`) driven headlessly via
  Playwright (installed `--no-save`, not added to `package.json` —
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright` already had a cached Chromium from prior
  sessions) across all 7 real routes (`/`, `/dashboard`, `/trade`,
  `/orders`, `/activity`, `/treasury`, `/settings`) plus a deliberate 404,
  at both 1440×900 desktop and 390×844 mobile viewports: zero console
  errors, zero page errors, zero failed/5xx network requests, zero
  horizontal overflow at either size, after the fixes above (the first pass
  caught bugs 6–8; every pass after the fixes was clean).
- Every interactive toggle on the Settings page (10 total) clicked
  programmatically and confirmed to actually flip its `aria-checked` state
  — catches exactly the class of bug the dead theme selector was (a control
  that does nothing) across the rest of the page; none found.
- Explorer URLs (`preview`/`preprod`/`mainnet` variants) all independently
  curl-verified live (200 OK) — not stale/placeholder domains.
- Confirmed the real deployed address now renders on `/settings` (was
  previously impossible to see it was broken without funding + deploying,
  which this session did).
- Re-ran the full test/typecheck/lint/build matrix (root, matcher, web)
  after every fix in this pass — all green throughout, no regressions.

### Demo flow readiness (mapped to the operator's 30-step checklist)

| 2–4 | Connect Wallet / network / balance | ⚠️ code-reviewed only, no extension available |
| 5–6 | Navigate Overview / Treasury | ✅ verified |
| 7–8 | Deposit Treasury / balance updates | ✅ live on-chain, confirmed via e2e-check + running Matcher REST reads |

| 10–11 | Trade page / live market data | ✅ verified, no placeholder text found |
| 12–14 | Place order / user↔user match / user↔PPM match | ✅ user↔user done live this pass (see above); user↔PPM (`settleWithProtocol`) still code-path-verified only, not live this pass |
| 15–19 | Settlement / Treasury / Orders / Activity / Overview updates | ✅ all confirmed via the live trade + Treasury lifecycle tests |
| 20 | WebSocket updates without refresh | ✅ architecture verified (`matcherClient.ts` reconnect logic, `use-treasury.ts` WS subscriptions), live-observed during the trade test (Matcher broadcasts `order.created`/`order.filled`/`treasury.*`) |
| 21–22 | Settings page / every control works | ✅ fixed this pass (bugs 6–8), all 10 toggles verified clicked |
| 23–24 | Network switching / wallet reconnect | ⚠️ code-reviewed only (`NetworkProvider.tsx`), no extension available |
| 25 | Explorer links | ✅ verified live (200 OK) |
| 26 | Contract Address display | ✅ fixed this pass (bug 8) |
| 27 | README links | ✅ verified — all 10 external doc/site links curl-checked live (200 OK), including every `docs.midnight.network` reference, `1am.xyz`, `lace.io/midnight`, and the GitHub repo itself |
| 28–29 | No console errors / no failed requests | ✅ verified clean across all routes, both viewports |
| 30 | Production build still succeeds | ✅ verified repeatedly throughout this pass |
